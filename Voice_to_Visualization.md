# Voice to Visualization

In today's fast-paced production industry, decision-making is often hampered by reliance on outdated reports. Business owners and higher management personnel typically lack the technical expertise to write SQL queries for accessing real-time data. Moreover, even when data is retrieved, interpreting raw datasets without proper visualization makes it challenging to derive actionable insights. This leads to delayed responses, missed opportunities, and inefficient operations.

Our project aims to bridge the gap between data accessibility and decision-making using Artificial Intelligence. By leveraging AI, we provide a seamless solution for accessing, analyzing, and visualizing real-time data. Key features of our project include:

## Project Overview
